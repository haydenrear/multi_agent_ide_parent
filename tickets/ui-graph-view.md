Currently there exists a view of each node in the graph in the UI, and we can cycle between the active nodes. However, there does not exist a graph view. So the graph view will be an item in the menu from which we can see the entire agent graph. So it will be a visualization, and then it will also stream some of the data happening for that node - so the idea here is that we'll be able to watch multiple agents working in parallel, and "sense something is off". Then, we'll be able to click on one of the graph nodes, and it will go to the node tab for that node.
