There is a question - how to get the memory tool to work most optimally. In other words, how to make is create/update mental models, facts in the most optimal way.

One experiment we can run is

- ask it to produce "study questions" and these study questions, posed, then flow into mental model updates

So taking this just a step further, we could do a sort of GAN analog, but in the context of study partners or even "tutors".

One, say, poses questions, in a testing manner, the other answers questions, poses updates to the mental models, etc. Adding this sort of judging behavior would be nice. And the nice thing is that the big model can be judge, and won't have to do as much output, and the input costs are much lower.
