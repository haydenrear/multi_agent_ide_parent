The collector should have the duty of weaving the agents results together. The discovery collector is a great example

Each discovery agent is like a scanner of a particular portion or slice of a repository or program. Then, the 
discovery collector must take these portions, and do it's own tool calls to weave their reports into a shared report
that ADDS CONTEXT and INSIGHT!

And during this process, make sure to use the memory. Similarly, the agents should be prompted to add mem for shared
insight.
