# Stock Follower Research Projects

One of the possibilities with project that develops any arbitrary discovery/planning/ticket is that you can run it on 
an arbitrary project. 

So then one of the projects will be stock follower research. We have a project for each stock/commodity, and then way
to access across - through memory and refs. Then we run it daily to develop research for that particular.  

The idea being that the research work for stocks from arbitrary analysts can be increasingly automated. And a constant
experimentation is necessary to determine points at which this is true.

REMEMBER !!! The best back-testing is daily. And using the real-world, of course. And we can therefore do this every 
day, to determine, with each model step, when it can be used, for which periods, at which risk tolerance.
