After adding spring shell support, then a tool should be added for testing the CLI.

Effectively, it needs to be able to read from the shell, and write to the same shell, and instructions. Like what web tester does, except CLI tester.

Can build on top of ACP tools - really just need to add another tool, send keys or something, and return the next.
