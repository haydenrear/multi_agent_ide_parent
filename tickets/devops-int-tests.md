Need to add docker to multiagentide project build.gradle.kts same as mcp-tool-gateway as an example, then import that 
into the build.gradle.kts in the test_graph project. Then, the step definitions need to be implemented, as well as the
computation graph nodes to assert. 

We'll need to then create the imposter files and add those to the step definitions, and get the integration tests running.
