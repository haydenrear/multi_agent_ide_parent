# Intellij

Gateway server can decorate intellij-mcp, and then all ops can intercept and find the project that contains the root,
sending to that (registering intellij projects at beginning)

-- this is only really needed if the prompt fails.

# Hindsight

This is needed to adapt the protocol version (hindsight doesn't work with OpenAI bc protocol mismatch and stdio).

Moreover, gateway server can be started at the beginning all tools for the decorator in @agent-skill-interrupts.md.
