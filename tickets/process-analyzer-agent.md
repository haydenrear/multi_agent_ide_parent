Process analysis is a critical component of the self-improving nature of the system. In particular, when the process completely fails there's pretty much always actions you can take, redeploy, and try again. So currently all of that is "manual", and even worse the AI doing it is almost always able to provide the solution. This means that the data from this workflow is not being captured in a structured way, resulting in difficulty identifying when it's happening for extracting it into a smaller agent.

It **is** something that can be extracted into a smaller model. Moreover, it is something that can feed back into the system for process improvement. Therefore, when the process fails the exception should be caught, and another @Agent should run which analyzes the results, and then we emit artifacts to the database for this.
