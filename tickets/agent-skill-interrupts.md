Before an agent runs (and this will be extracted for a supervisor), and interrupt is thrown which asks the reviewer 
which skills and tools to include, out of these tools that are defaulted. Additionally, it asks if the instructions
for particular skills.

Particularly, it seems that a lot of time you may be forced to ask the agent to read the skill instructions. So this
allows for you to change it so that it automatically includes the instructions for the skills as well.

So then you can change the MCP servers, remove/add particular tools, and then add particular parts of skills.

So this is a tree option menu in a modal - but any option at any level includes all levels below.

So then, nicely, this option can be extracted into a supervisor and controller.
